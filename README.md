# landing_page
Creating a landing page project by TheOdinProject with their template of how the landing page should look like:
![landing page](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d953c12b-1ed9-44ed-ba26-1f4e3e70bad2)

Decided to get more creative by making it similar to a tuition centre homepage.
- Utilised the different CSS styling methods learnt, especially making use of FlexBox
- Created a "Register Now" form page which will appear when users click on the "sign up" button
- Consists of a few sections: Hero section to attract users, programmes and classes section that highlights the subjects the tuition offers, an inspirational quote, and a sign up section.
- Attempted to create a "sign up" form as well
